# Chicago_Crime_Analysis

I. Introduction 
---------------
This project is Data Analysis of crime in The City of Chicago from January 2001 to August, 2019. There has been rising attention to the issue of crimes in big citieis, e.g San Francisco, New York City. I chose Chicago because I have visited Chicago several times and enjoyed the weather during summer and city live there. The availability of open datasets with high quality has also made it possible for data enthusiastics to do investigations around this issue. 

In this project, I performed big data analysis and modeling on the Chicago crime data. The analyses were implemented by Spark SQL and Spark ML. 

The first part is a OLAP for crime events. Insights were drawn from descriptive analyses and visualizations of crime rates w.r.t crime type, police districts, date and time. Travel suggestions were provided to visit the city of Chicago; advice were made to police distribution on dates/areas with high crime rates. 

The second part is a clustering analysis and visualization of the spatial distribution of the crime events. 

II. Dataset
